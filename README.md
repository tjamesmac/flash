# Make a learning reference site

Want to make a quick reference site to help my continued learning

What I want to include in this

- No react
- All typescript
- Tested
- CI/CD (docker, github actions etc)
- Help with system design
- Include a flash card function
- Deploy to Azure because the cosmo nosql is free && app engine equivalent is free

TODO:
- Read about Deploying to Azure.
- This means finding out how to integrate github repo so I dont have to stick my code in there


Tasks:
Go a step further
Make a library - a tutorial library
Want to see if I can make a book.

(By this I mean output my the content I want in a similar format to a book)

Cover
Contents
Rest are chapters

Give the option to go to next page

So I have a shelf
|---------------|   |---------------| 
|               |   |               |
|  Algorithms   |   |   Databases   |
|               |   |               |
|---------------|   |---------------|

There are two books on the shelf

Book {
    genre
    title
    author
    created
    lastupdated
    last reviewed
}

Shelf {
    books
    last updated
    some others things
}
